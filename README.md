The aim of our project was to explore data of electric vehicle population in Washington, USA, in order to identify insights including the most popular brands of electric cars in Washington, and Washington counties that have the highest population of electric cars.

From our analysis, we concluded that:
- The population of electric vehicles in Washington has steadily increased since January 2017. As of October 31 2021, Washington had 82,851 electric vehicles, making up 1.36% of their total vehicles. 
- The Washington county of San Juan has the highest percentage of electric vehicles out of total vehicles with 2.96% (600 electric vehicles out of 20267 total vehicles), while the county of King has by far the highest count of electric vehicles with 43352 vehicles, making up 2.78% of their total vehicles.
- Tesla is the most popular manufacturer of electric vehicles in Washington with 36443 vehicles (42.3% of population).
- There are 61,335 (73.9%) total plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and 21,719 (26.1%) total battery electric vehicles in Washington.

We believe this data analysis could be useful for electric vehicle brands to determine the market demand of electric vehicles in Washington. This could include determining locations to advertise their vehicles and establish dealerships, as well as identifying which make and type of electric vehicle is most popular. Our analysis also demonstrates a steady increase of electric vehicle population in Washington, which is useful information to indicate to brands, shareholders, and other stakeholders that there is consistent demand for electric vehicles in Washington.

# project-1

We aim to explore datasets to identify insights regarding the population of electric vehicles such as the most popular brands of electric cars and the regions within Washington, USA and South Australia that have the highest population of electric cars.


**To Do List

If you want to complete a particular task, write your name against the task!
If you would like to record notes of what you’re up to with each task or what issues you are facing, do so in the ‘Project Progress Notes’ document.

Tasks:
Use Pandas to clean and format dataset for use in analysis - Sri
Electric Vehicle Population data - Sri
Electric Vehicle Population Size History by County - Ali
Explore dataset and develop insights - make summary tables (e.g. mean, median, mode, max, min) to identify possible findings 
Electric Vehicle Population data (Washington)
What make and model of electric car is most popular in each county of Washington? - Ali
Electric Vehicle Population Size History by County
What has the highest population in the US out of battery EVs or plug-in EVs? - Kaumudi
How has the adoption of electric vehicles changed over time in the US (e.g. the last 3 years)? Can we project how this trend will continue? (use full history) - Hay 
What states and counties of the US have the highest populations of electric cars? (use just the latest month of population - October 2021) - Megan
Use Matplotlib and GMap to develop visualisations of data 
Refer to ‘Visualisations Ideas’ document to see what visualisations we might like to create (will determine who will do what later - Megan is happy to do at least half of these) - hay can attempt the other half 
Create write-up to summarise key findings  
Keep notes of your key findings, then we can put this together in a report format -hay(will write up report after findings) (Megan also happy to help with this)
Develop presentation to present on analysis process and key findings - Group effort!
